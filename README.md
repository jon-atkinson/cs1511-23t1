Welcome to the Tut code!!!

This repo contains all of the code written in the F09D tutorials this term

If you don't know how to use git, that's ok. Just click through the folder system at the top of this page to find the right week and then the right file. 

If you want the code a litte more readable, try copy pasting it into a code text editor, such as vscode in vlab!
